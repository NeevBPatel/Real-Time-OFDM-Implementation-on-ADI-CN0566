# Real-Time-OFDM-Implementation-on-ADI-CN0566
This repository provides a real-time OFDM transceiver implementation. Built with Python, it leverages the ADALM-PLUTO Software-Defined Radio and the Analog Devices CN0566 Phaser kit. The system features 16-QAM modulation, adaptive timing synchronization, zero-forcing equalization, and live constellation visualization.
